# How to run the application

## Backend
* Import the Postman Collection file in my Github, if you want to test.
## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
note: if the npm install error, you should try with node@14 on mac and a similar version on another platform.
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless Diary application.
